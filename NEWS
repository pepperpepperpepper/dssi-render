Version 0.1.1:
-------------
Can now do multiple configure key-value pairs.

Added an assert(isfinite()) to check synth output.


Version 0.1.2:
-------------
Some cleaning up.

Default midi note is now middle C (note 60).

Added -p -2 option - generates random port values.


Version 0.1.3:
-------------
New option, -b, clips out-of-bounds data, including NaN and Inf,
instead of just exiting.

New option, -r, sets the length of the release tail. Omit it to allow the
release tail to die to silence (up to maximum of 15s).
